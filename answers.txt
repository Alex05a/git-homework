Question Answers 
1. What is the difference between git add and git commit?
- git add puts files into the staging area, basically getting them ready to be saved
- git commit actually saves those staged changes to the repository history with a descriptive message

2. What happens if you delete the .git folder?
- You lose all the version history and Git tracking for that project
- The folder just becomes a normal folder without any Git functionality
- All your previous commits and branches are gone and can't be recovered

3. Why should you never share your private key (id_rsa)?
- It's basically like giving someone your password to everything
- Other people could pretend to be you and get into your private repositories
- It puts your security at risk and allows unauthorized people to access your stuff
